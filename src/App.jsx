// How React Update only updated changes in RealDOM?🙄
// Component >> Instance >> ReactElement >> Rendered phase >> Commit phase >> Browser paint🤒🤕

// Now also understand How React works behind the scense😀
// Component:-
// Describe peace of UI
// Javascript function that return React Element means JSX(component) >> React.createElement() >> ReactElement

// Instance:-
// Instace are created each time whenever Component are called
// inside the App func, Comp call three time so App has now three child and each instance hold
// their own state,props,event,lifcyle or all three are independly(different)

// ReactElement:-
// JSX converted to React.createElement() function call
// then result of React.createElement() function call is ReactElement
// The result is a big object that contain all important information to insert in RealDOM
// ReactElement is not inserted to dom but first converted Html Element then place to dom

// Render Phase:-
// Render process run in only two situations:
// 1. first entire App was rendered
// 2. update State(re-render)
// rendering is done in react internally not in dom
// Render is a procees will study write now😎

// Render work
// 1) All ReactElements created from all instance in component Tree
// are store in one tree called virtual DOM

// virtual DOM:-
// First Defination: In React all the instance become ReactElement this ReactElement call virtualDOM.
// 2nd Defination: virtualDOM Tree of all ReactElements created by all instances in component Tree.

// Describe:-
// when any state change in suppose D comp so React call that comp again and create new
// ReactElement then replce it with oldOne or indirectly new virtul DOM created with updated ReactElement
// Note: all nested child comps will re-reder when parent comp will render or call😂
// why it's happen because React doesn't know it's child will be effected or not😂 that's why rather than
// rendering a comp it also re-render it's children😂

// Reconciliation + Diffing:-
// After creating new virtualDOM will Reconciliation+Diffing with current fiber tree(before state update)
// This reconciliation done by React's Reconciler called Fiber then it's result called updated fiber tree
// did you scared?😂

// let's understand what is Reconciliation in React?
// In the browser, DOM manipulation is expensive and time consuming and slow, both in mounting and unmounting.
// The “reconciliation” algorithm in React Deciding which DOM Element actually need to be inserted, deleted or updated
// in order to reflect the latest state changes.😀
// It's done by reconciler and currently reconciler called fiber

// Important Topic😲:-
// Diffing Algorithem:-
// diffing: is part of recociliation process
// diffing:- comparing Elements btw two renders step by step base on their position in the tree
// diffing has two fundamental Rule:-
// 1. Two elements of different types will produce different Tree🌴
// 2. Elements with stable key props stay the same across renders
//
// Now there three different situation
// 1. SAME POSITION, TWO DIFFERENT ELEMENTS BTW TWO RENDERS
// 2. SAME POSITION, SAME ELEMENT
// 3. DIFFERENT POSITION, SAME ELEMENT

// 1. If parent Node has been replace  with other tag or componenet or position change
// React assume that entire sub-tree is no longer exit
// hence distroy these sub-tree including state and children although children did not change anythings yet it rebuild😂

// 2. If re-render same element and same position but change it's props attribute
// Element will be kept as well as it's children with including state
// and if we want to referesh or again re-render in order to referesh state then use key props

// 3. If poistion change of any element React will distory old one and re-create in dom Element
// if in before the two same child Component has new same comp inserted then rest two position change hence
// react will distory these two child and recreated in dom but will slow the performance of application.
// in order to increse performace use key props

// what is key props🔑:-
// It's special props that use to tell diffing algorithm that an element is unique
// Allow React to distinguish btw multiple instances of same compoenents
// soluation of 3rd situation Element will keep in dom althought position is different but reset the state
// when key is changes during render that element or component re-build with fresh state
// (Even SAME POSITION, SAME ELEMENT)

// Now what is Fiber and what it does?😂
// like virtualDOM Fiber also take component tree in it's first render of Application or initialStage of App
// and make Fiber Tree😂
// In Fiber Tree every instance and element has Fiber
// Fiber:- keep track of current state, props, sideEffect, used hook, Queue of Work also known as Unit Of Work🤕
// unlike virtualDOM, Fiber do not recreate on every re-render
// In Fiber work can be done asynchronously like:-
// Rendering process can be split into chuncks, task can be prioritzed and work can be paused, reused, or throw away

// Updated Fiber Tree
// after reconciliation process it produce updated Fiber Tree then all neccesary updated element store in
// List Of DOM Update

// Now let's review whatever we learnt yet😟
// step1. virtualDOM & Fiber Tree will created from All instances or component Tree🌴
// step2. if any state change and one comp remove so virtualDOM will re-created or updated but one Fiber Tree
// step3. Reconciliation+Diffing will compare Fiber Tree with updated virtualDOM and produced Updated Fiber Tree
// step4. durring Reconciliation process Fiber walk through entire tree steb by step and analyzes excatly what need
// to change betweeb current Fiber Tree and updated Fiber Tree based on new virtualDOM this process step by step
// called diffing and diffing algorithem

// COMMIT PHASE
// Then list of updated DOM Update to real DOM
// React Doesn't touch DOM. React only renders. It doesn't know where the render result will go🤨
// updated Fiber Tree update The DOM step by step(synchronous) by a Librart called ReactDom() and React from React imported for render phase
// then Browser notice that DOM has changed then Browser Repaint screen😀
// After commit phase or complete the task the updated Fiber Tree became current Fiber Tree for next render cycle

// Extra Knowledge:
// Renderers :-
// They commit the result of render phase
// React can be used on different platform("host")
// renderes example:-
// ReactDOM:             Chrome,Firefox,safari Browser
// ReactNative:          ios android
// Remotion:             video
// Many others:          pdf doc figma
//
//

// Two Type of Logic in React Component
// 1.RENDERE LOGIC
// 2.EVENT LOGIC

// 1.RENDERE LOGIC:-
// Execute everyTime the compoenent render
// Principle:-
// 1.component must be pure:- Give same props must return same output JSX it called pure component
// 2.Render Logic must product no side Effect means no interaction with outside world like
// don't update directly DOM
// don't mutate object variable props outside of function scope that's why props are immutable

// 2.EVENT LOGIC:-
// Execute on event happen
// Event handler function are not render logic hence it allow side Effect in eventHandleFunction😀
// and ther special hook to resigister sideEffect called UseEffect()
// React use Event propagation to id root of all events

// Update State Batching:
// Do not think on every state change immidiately render application and immidiately update state🙄
// when click on button in eventJHandler function first of all state batching then render application😮
// then now update the state😮
//
//

// REACT 3RD-PARTY LIBRARY ECO-SYSTEM:-
// React use many Libraries that lead react to next level😂
// For Example:
// 1. Routing:                                 React Router, ReactLocation
// 2. Http Request:                            Fetch(), Axios()
// 3. Remote state Management:                 ReactQuery, swr, apollo
// 4. Global state Management:                 ReactQuery, swr, Apollo
// 5. Remote state Management:                 ContextApi, Rdux, Zustand
// 6. Styling:                                 css modules, styleCompoenet,tailwindcss
// 7. Form Management:                         React Hook Form, FormMilk
// 8. Animation/Transitiont:                   motion, react-spring
// 9.Ui compoenent                             ui material, chakra, mantine

// React Framwork
// 1.NEXT.JS
// 2.Remix
// Gatsby
